    <p>
      TwilioTable was created because demos and POCs need a persistence
      layer and Twilio has Twilio Sync. We should be able to use Sync for simple
      use cases. TwilioTable includes a SPA front end to manage lists of data and
      a set of functions to CRUD the data.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also manage you data directly from the Twilio Console.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since TwilioTable is in the Twilio platfom so it is easy to integrate with
      Twilio products like Twilio Functions, Studio, Flex, Conversations API, and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      To use TwilioTable, you just need to create a Twilio Sync Service, set the SID 
      in the .env file for the TwilioTable Functions Service, and then access the data
      from a browser.
